## Introduction

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem-solving repository! This repository is dedicated to solving various DSA problems from platforms like LeetCode, Hackerrank, and other coding challenges to enhance my problem-solving skills. I aim to join the A2SV community by showcasing my progress and dedication in solving these challenges.

## Contents

In this repository, you will find the following:

1. **Solutions:** My Python solutions to various DSA problems.
2. **Code Templates:** Reusable code templates for common algorithms and data structures.
3. **Progress:** A log of my progress, indicating the date when I started working on the projects (July 18, 2023).

## Why Python?

I have chosen Python as my primary programming language for solving DSA problems due to its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Python allows me to focus more on the problem-solving logic, making it easier to implement complex algorithms and data structures.
